# News_Short
 <h3> Project Overview</h3>
<p>A bit overview, it uses newsapi.org API to get news and get JSON data back. Then it is parsed using google's gson library and the requests are sent by volly.</p>
<h3>Api Key</h3>
<p>To run the app you have to add <a href="https://newsapi.org/register" rel="nofollow">NewsAPI.org</a>key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News.</p>
